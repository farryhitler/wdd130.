        <p>Calabar is a city located in southeastern Nigeria, serving as the capital of Cross River State. The city has a rich history and cultural heritage that dates back centuries. In the pre-colonial era, Calabar was a hub for trade and commerce, attracting European explorers and traders. The Efik people, the indigenous inhabitants of the region, played a significant role in the city's development. The city became a major center for the transatlantic slave trade, with European powers establishing trade posts along the Calabar River. During the colonial period, Calabar was part of the British Empire, and it served as the capital of the Southern Protectorate. The city played a crucial role in British administration and became a center for missionary activities. The Christian missionary influence is still evident in the city today, with numerous churches and religious institutions. Calabar was a key port and administrative center throughout the colonial era. After Nigeria gained independence in 1960, Calabar continued to be an important city, and it later became the capital of Cross River State when the state was created in 1976. Today, Calabar is known for its diverse cultural festivals, including the popular Calabar Carnival, which is one of the largest street parties in Africa. The city has a mix of modern infrastructure and historical landmarks, reflecting its complex history. Calabar remains an important economic and cultural center in Nigeria, attracting tourists and serving as a hub for trade and commerce in the region.</p>
